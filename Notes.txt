Ep-2 
(31:48) =>
There are two packages/dependencies that we can install,
1. Dev Dependencies - devDependencies in a package.json file  are packages that are used during the development and testing of a project but are not required for the application to run in a production environment.(When we are in developing we require Dev Dependencies)
2. Normal Dependencies - It is use production 

(37:11) => (Video me galat bataya hai)
Tilde (~):
Restricts updates to only patch releases within the same minor version. For example, "~1.2.3" would allow versions 1.2.4, 1.2.5, etc., but not 1.3.0. 

Caret (^) :
Allows updates within the same major version, but also minor and patch releases. For example, "^1.2.3" would allow versions 1.2.4, 1.2.5, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, etc., but not 2.0.0. 


(48:35) => 
Transitive Dependencies => A transitive dependency in computer science refers to a functional dependency pattern where the value of one attribute is determined by another attribute, which in turn is determined by a third attribute.

like we just installed wanted to install parcel (npm install -D parcel), but we got a node _modules, in which there are many many files, why? Beacuse parcel has its dependencies, its dependencies has its dependencies, and that dependencies has its own dependencies and so on...

jsx - HTML-like or XML-like syntax BUT it is not HTML in js file, both are different

Ep-5

(44:38)
There are two types of export/import

-Default Export/Import: 
export default Component;
import Component from "path";

-Named Export/Import:
export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";

#React Hooks - it is a normal JS utility functions
 There are 2 very imp hooks:
 - useState()
 - useEffect()

(1:37:38)
Whenever the state variable changes react re-render its component.

(1:59:57)
Why react is fast?
Because it is doing efficient DOM manipulation, and react can find difference between virtual DOMs and update it.

(00: 54 :00)
Shimmer UI - A shimmer UI is a version of the UI that doesn't contain actual content, but instead mimics the layout and shapes of the content that will eventually appear

(1:04:14)
Condistional Rendering - Rendering on the basis of a condition is know as Condistional rendering.

(1:53:20)
Whenever the state variable update, react trigger a reconciliation cycle(re-render the component)

Ep-7 part 1
(05:05)
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("No dependency")
});
If there are no dependency array in useEffect then it will be called/run on every render.

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Empty dependency")
},[]);
If the dependency array is empty then useEffect is called on only inetial render, and just once.

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("Dependency present")
}[dependency]);
If there a dependency is useEffect then it is called/run every time the dependency changes.

# 2 types of Routing in web apps
- Clint Side Routing
- Server Side Routing

Ep-8 part 1
Class Based Component
(12:15)
Functional Component: It is a function that returns some JSX,
Class Based Component: It is a class which extend react.componet has a render method which returns some piece of JSX,

(20:10)
Why do we have to write super props?

(41:30)
NEVER update state variables directly.

Ep-9
Single Responsibility Principle ----  SRP (my own shortcut)

(06:15)
Feature of SRP:
1. Code becomes more reusable.
2. Code become more maintainable.
3. Code become more testable.

(09:15)
Hook is just a utility function,

Benifits of making custom hooks:-
1. Make code more readable
2. Make code more modular
3. Make code more reusable

online/offline feature

Chunking        // These all are the same thing, (same meaning, different name)
Code Splitting
Dynamic Bundling
Lazy Loading
On Demand Loading
Dynamic Import


Personal brand is a concious and intentional effort

Ep-11 part-1
Higher Order Component

Higher order component is a function that takes a component and returns a component.
