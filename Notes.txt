There are two packages/dependencies that we can install,
1. Dev Dependencies - devDependencies in a package.json file  are packages that are used during the development and testing of a project but are not required for the application to run in a production environment.(When we are in developing we require Dev Dependencies)
2. Normal Dependencies - It is use production
